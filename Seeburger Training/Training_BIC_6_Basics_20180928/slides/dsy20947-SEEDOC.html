<h8 daisyBranch="1" daisyDocument="3247-SEEDOC" daisyLanguage="2" id="dsy3247-SEEDOC">Usage of Multiple Doc Readers and Writers</h8>
        
<p>It is possible to create different reading and writing sources, different
readers and writers within a single mapping, and to switch between them during
conversion. This is an advanced and powerfull feature, but It has limited
support in the BIC Mapping Designer user interface. The use of drag-and-drop or
input completion does only work for the primary input and output formats which
are visible. Especially note the following:</p>
        
<ol>
            
<li>The creation of new files, stream sources, or destinations (so-called doc
reader and doc writer) and the switching between them can only be managed with
the use of mapping commands.</li>
            
<li>A single mapping can contain only record mapping programs for <strong>a
single</strong> source message description. Therefore the usage of multiple
readers has the following constraints:</li>
            
<ul>
                
<li>All doc readers must use the same message type and the same message
description.</li>
            
</ul>
            
<ul>
                
<li>All identical segments/records of <strong>all </strong>doc readers are
calling the same record mapping program in the mapping. It does not matter which
doc reader is currently in use. Take care about the "correct use" and the
management of the different doc readers in the mapping code of that record
mapping program.</li>
            
</ul>
            
<li>There are no such constraints for doc writers. It is possible to create any
possible different output file or stream using different message types and
different message descriptions (e.g. simultaneous use of XML and EDIFACT).</li>
            
<li>The graphical representation of a mapping in the BIC Mapping Designer still
contains only the main/default doc reader and writer. It does not matter if you
use and access different doc readers/writers in the mapping. A validation of the
addresses used in the mapping code is done against the default doc reader and
writer only. The usage of a doc writer of a different type or message
descriptions may result in compilation warnings (compiler version 2). The
compiler version 1 does not check addresses at all, so it should be possible to
compile the mapping without any further problem.</li>
            
<li>The integration in BIS 6 allows the creation of multiple destination message
attachments. If your doc writer should create a new destination attachment,
please use the word "automatically" as file name.</li>
            
<li>In XI 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 or 2.0, 2.1,2.2 it is NOT possible to access multiple
attachments with multiple doc readers from within a mapping.</li>
            
<li>For BIC in BIC MD and BIS6 it is possible to have multiple sources by also
using the file name "automatically" for the <em>setDocReader</em>.</li>
            
<li>In the BIS 6 and SAP XI environment conversions are managed by the runtime,
the use of direct file access (by name) or re-use of input streams is not
possible.</li>
            
<li>Configuration commands (<em>setSourceDelimiter</em>, etc.) work on the
current doc reader/writer. You have to call them after the doc reader/ writer is
initialized and switched. These settings are only valid for the currently
activated doc reader/writer. If you switch the doc reader, the changes take
effect after the current mapping record program is finished, and the next record
will be read from the new active reader.</li>
            
<li>Whenever a record mapping program is finished, BIC continues with reading on
the current activated doc reader. To continue with reading in another doc
reader, please switch to that reader.</li>
            
<li>Every doc reader and writer does its own syntax check. Each syntax check
does not affect the others.</li>
            
<li>Global procedures have a special behavior: they are initialized with the
default doc reader and writer (main source/destination stream). Global
procedures are not affected by switchDocReder/Writer calls outside in the
mapping. If the doc reader/writer should be switched within a global procedure,
the switchDocRedaer/writer command has to be executed there, too. This also does
not affext the doc reader/writer settings of the main mapping.</li>
