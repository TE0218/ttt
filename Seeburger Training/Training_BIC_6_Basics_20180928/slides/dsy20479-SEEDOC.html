<p>The combo boxes in the

allow it to select two mappings. So it is possible to work (test) two mappings
in a row. Accordingly, two tabs are provided for the data and parameter section.
</p>
        
<p>The operations, which are possible in the <em>Test Environment</em>, process
always all selected mappings in row - e. g. if the <em>Compile</em> button is
pressed and two mappings are selected, the first and second mapping are compiled
one after another.</p>
        
<p>Each operation attempts always to work on all selected mappings. Missing or
erroneous data may however have the effect that only one (or none) of the two
selected mappings are processed.</p>
        
<h10 id="s34">Appearance of Mappings</h10>
        
<h11 id="s35">Project Explorer</h11>
        
<p>The BIC Mapping Designer presents mappings as nodes in the
Project View. Selecting them there selects
automatically in an opened <em>Test Environment</em> a
Mappings Configuration in the belonging combo
box on the .</p>
        
<p>The selected Mappings Configuration is</p>
        
<ul>
            
<li>using the selected mapping in the project view as first mapping</li>
            
<li>the last used one which fits.</li>
        
</ul>
        
<p>This (initial) combo box selection can be changed into any other selection.
</p>
        
<p>The combo boxes contain the names of all the mappings in the currently
selected project. A project change through a selection change in the
Project View is updating the mapping names
accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
        
<h11 id="dsy24046-SEEDOC_JCN Folder">JCN Folder</h11>
        
<p>Mappings may be available as JCN files. In this case they don't appear in the
Project View, instead they are located in a
predefined folder structure below <em>src/jcn</em>:</p>
        
<p align="center">
            
<a href="images/24042-SEEDOC_1_2_2.jpg"><img bookStorePath="/data/resources/24042-SEEDOC_1_2_2" p:imageHeight="193" p:imageWidth="372" src="images/24042-SEEDOC_1_2_2.jpg"></a>
        
</p>
        
<h12 id="dsy24046-SEEDOC_JCN Folder">JCN files in the Test Environment</h12>
        
<p>The names of those JCN files appear in the mapping combo boxes in the
 as well.</p>
        
<p>It is possible to work with JCN files in the <em>Test Environment </em>as
with ordinary mappings, except that the editing of the belonging mapping source
code is impossible.</p>
        
<p>Because of their project independent nature, mapping JCN files - if found in
the corresponding folder - are always contained as mapping combo box entries
independently of any Project View selection.
</p>
        
<h12 id="dsy24046-SEEDOC_JCN files in the Compile JCN Mappings Dialogue">JCN files in the Compile
JCN Mappings Dialogue</h12>
        
<p>The names of those JCN files appear in the <em>Compile JCN Mappings
Dialogue</em> (invoked through the last toolbar icon) as objects which can be
selected for a compilation. This dialogue makes it is possible to compile all
JCN files into the test or production system.</p>
        
<h12 id="s36">Content Creation</h12>
        
<p>The JCN folder needs to be filled manually via physical file system.</p>
        
<p>An alternative way to generate the requested folder structure is to invoke
the BIC Mapping Designer Delivery
functionality. The generated folder structure in the delivery destination folder
can then be copied 1:1 into the <em>src/jcn</em> folder.</p>
        
<h12 id="s37">Compilation</h12>
        
<p>The compilation of mappings (or mappings provided through JCN files) is
triggered through the corresponding buttons</p>
        
<ul>
            
<li>on the toolbar</li>
            
<li>in the test environment (eventually used in a mapping configuration)</li>
            
<li>deliver mappings dialogue</li>
            
<li>compile JCN mappings dialogue - in principle the same dialogue as the
deliver mappings dialogue, but only those
mappings are presented which are based on all found mapping JCN files.</li>
        
</ul>
        
<p>The deliver mappings respectively JCN mappings dialogue has the advantage
that all mappings can be compiled in one step.</p>
        
<p>Once compiled, the mappings are available as java- and class files in the
test- or production system.</p>
        
<h12 id="s38">Conversion</h12>
        
<p>The converter will process the generated class files during a conversion. Its
class path settings determine how message formats, codelist files and mapfiles
are found. Typically - for operation within the Test Environment - the
<em>src</em> folder is assumed to be the root for them.</p>
        
<p>However, in case of a conversion with mappings which are provided through JCN
files, the <em>src/jcn</em> folder will contain its own set of project folders,
codelists and mapfiles (see illustration before) which is then respected.</p>
        
<p>Critical mixed cases are possible when a mapping from a BIC Mapping Designer
project is invoking a child mapping which is based on a provided JCN file. In
order to find the message formats for both mappings the converter will evaluate
at first the content below <em>src</em> and then below <em>src/jcn</em> .
Different message formats but with an identical name may lead here to conflicts.
In order to mininize that the <em>src/jcn</em> folder may be
excluded from the class
path (included as standard).</p>
        
<h9 daisyBranch="1" daisyDocument="6879-SEEDOC" daisyLanguage="2" id="dsy6879-SEEDOC">Message Editor</h9>
        
<h10 id="s39">Introduction</h10>
        
<p>The <em>Message Editor</em> allows it to visualize and to edit the structure
of message (-data). The terms <em>message</em> and <em>message format</em> must
be separated from each other; one of the main features of the BIC Mapping
Designer is to show and to modify the structure of a valid message format, but
the <em>Message Editor</em> is especially tailored to treat finally the messages
which have to fit to those message formats.</p>
        
<p>Aside from visualization, the possibility to modify or create a message is
the main benefit of the <em>Message Editor</em>. Every change is checked against
the corresponding message format so that only valid messages may be assembled.
</p>
        
<h10 id="dsy6879-SEEDOC_StartMessageEditor">Start</h10>
        
<p align="left">The <em>Message Editor</em> can be called through a right click
on a <em>message format </em>node. This will open the context menu, where the
entry <em>Open message editor</em> should be selected.</p>

<p>This will open a <em>File chooser</em>, which allows to select a message
anywhere in the file system. A message and a message format are necessary
together to start the<em> Message Editor</em>.</p>
        
<p>A <em>Configuration </em>dialog is opened after the <em>File chooser,</em>
in the most cases, you only&nbsp;have to confirm the preselected standard assumptions
in it. Detailed settings can be made in regard to how messages are read into the
memory and written out onto the file system. Please refer to the section
.</p>
        
<p>The second possibility to start the <em>Message Editor</em> is through a
selected mapping in the <em>Test Environment</em>. Input-, output- and reference
files are messages, and have fit to the source and destination message format of
this mapping. The right outer button besides each text field containing the
message file name and path on the file system allows here further the

<p align="left">All buttons to open the message (files) can be configured so
that favorite editors are associated with them. Usually the <em>Message
Editor</em> will be opened with the second button - right of the file browser -
and the third button (for an alternative editor) is associated with a more
simple editor, e. g. <em>Notepad</em>, to enable also a quick view on the plain
file. The link between the buttons and the editors can be configured through the
<em>editors preference page</em>.</p>
        
<h10 id="s40">Operating</h10>
