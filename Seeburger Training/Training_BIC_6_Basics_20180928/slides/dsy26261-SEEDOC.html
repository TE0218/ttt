<p>Messages, mappings, and global procedures may be compared with each other.
Backbone for the ability is the BIC Converter which supports comparing of
converted data with reference data as it can be found in the test environment.
Here the messages, mappings, and global procedures are just interpreted as XML
files which could have been involved in a conversion. The belonging message
formats for compare are fix and can be found after each installation in
<em>[Installation Path]\conf </em>as <em>msg_CompareGlobalProcedures.xml</em>,
<em>msg_CompareMapping.xml</em> and <em>msg_CompareMessage.xml</em>.</p>
        
<h9 id="s29">Invocation</h9>

- entry <em>Compare with.</em>
            
</li>
            
<li>Through dragging a proper node on another node to compare both with each
other.</li>

<p>If not filled yet completely, the user has to enter the missing data. If the
data is somehow erroneous a continuation - e.g. clicking on the <em>OK</em>
button - is impossible.</p>
        
<p>The colored background marks the text field which is currently receiving the
user input. The point of interest is here, that the user can click on any node
in the background project view, and the focused text field will be filled with
the corresponding name.</p>
        
<p>For a greater flexibility even files from the physical file system can be
chosen through a click on the <em>Browse</em> button next to each text field.
Choosing a file from the physical file system has to assure that only equal
objects are compared with each other, i. e. messages should only be compared
with messages, mappings with mappings and global procedures with global
procedures.</p>
        
<p>If you click on the <em>OK</em> button, the compare operation continues as
described for the compare feature included in the
<em>test environment</em>.</p>
        
<h9 id="s31">Typical Use Cases</h9>
        
<h10 id="s32">Repository</h10>
        
<p>A favorite usage of the compare tool is to detect the differences of the
local source code with the source code in the repository. Therefore the objects
in the repository are imported into another (new) project in BIC Mapping
Designer. Comparing now project-wide unveils the differences which a user
created in between through editing his local source code in BIC Mapping Designer
compared to his previously committed code in the repository, or compared to the
contributions into the repository of another code developer.&nbsp;</p>
