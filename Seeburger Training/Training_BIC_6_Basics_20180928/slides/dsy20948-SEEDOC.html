<p>Child mappings are usual mappings but they are not called by a BIC component
but by another mapping (= parent mapping).</p>
            
</li>
            
<li>
                
<p>During the execution the main mapping is suspended. The main mapping is
resumed when the child mapping is finished. It is also possible to call another
child mapping within a child mapping.</p>
            
</li>
            
<li>
                
<p>Compared to the multireader / multiwriter feature child mappings are easier
to handle but also have some more constraints and limits because it is not
possible to switch from one mapping to the other one and vice versa.</p>
            
</li>
            
<li>
                
<p>It is possible to transfer data between main and child mapping using the
commands setInputValue / getInputValue or setOutputValue / getOutputValue.</p>

<h8 daisyBranch="1" daisyDocument="3248-SEEDOC" daisyLanguage="2" id="dsy3248-SEEDOC">Usage of Child Mappings</h8>
        
<p>The second option of using multiple input and output files or streams is the
usage of child mappings within the main mapping. In comparison to the set/switch
doc reader/writer functionality, this implementation has some more constraints
and limits because it is not possible to switch from one mapping to the other
one and vice versa.</p>
        
<p>A child mapping is always executed when it is called. During this execution
the main mapping is suspended. The main mapping is resumed when the child
mapping is finished. It is also possible to call another child mapping within a
child mapping.</p>
        
<p>All input and output parameters of a main mapping are also valid for all
child mappings. So it is possible to transfer data between main and child
mapping using the commands /  or
/
.</p>
        
<p>A child mapping is generally a normal mapping as usual and can be created and
executed separately from the main mapping. Therefore the creation of such
mappings is much easier than the work with multiple doc readers and writers.
Each separate child mapping has its own source and destination message
descriptions, all used addresses can be created in the mapping view using the
drag&amp;drop method.</p>
